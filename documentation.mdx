11. Or you can select Click to Upload and select the .jsonld file saved to your local computer.
12. Under "In Space" select the correct space. This is important to make sure you are uploading the data model to the correct space!
13. For Import type, if this is your first time importing click "Dynamic". In the future, if you re-import the data model, you will want to click "Merge" (This is especially important to avoid the dynamic import so you don't get duplicate nodes)
