You, or your child, may be eligible to take part in a research study. This form gives you important information about the study. It describes the purpose of this research study, and the risks and possible benefits of participating. 
In the sections that follow, the word ""we"" means the study doctor and other research staff. If you are a parent or legal guardian who is giving permission for a child, please note that the word ""you"" refers to your child.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
studyoverview,informed_consent,Study Overview,descriptive,"You are being asked to take part in this research study because you have neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and have been diagnosed with a brain tumor (glioma).

The purpose of this study is to improve the care of people with NF1 and brain tumors. The main goal of the study is to describe treatment approaches and outcomes for children and adults with NF1-associated high grade glioma, as well as for adults with newly diagnosed NF1-associated low grade glioma. We are interested in determining if there are clinical characteristics, such as sex or tumor location, that may place patients at higher risk of developing more aggressive brain tumors or having a worse response to treatment. Your participation in this study would involve allowing us to gather clinical information and images such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) from your medical record and review the results of genetic testing previously done on your tumor. If you have not had prior testing on your tumor, and there is leftover tumor tissue available, we will perform detailed testing on your tumor specimen to learn more about the genetic changes (DNA) of your tumor. We plan to include a maximum of 185 patients from multiple institutions in this study, with a maximum of 15 subjects enrolled at CHOP.

The main risk of the study is breach of confidentiality.

You will not benefit directly from participating in this study.

If there is anything in this form you do not understand, please ask questions. Please take your time. 

You do not have to take part in this study if you do not want to. If you take part, you can leave the study at any time.

The study investigator and other study staff will not use your information and results for any reason other than for the study. To protect your private information, all your information will be labeled and identified by a special code number. All information will be stored on a password protected computers or in a locked filing cabinet in a study staff's locked office. <br /><br /><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Risks of Genetic Studies</span>: The risks related to genetic analyses can be to individuals or to groups. These harms include stigmatization and insurability. To reduce this risk, only coded samples will be stored and used for future research. Information about this study will not be recorded in your medical record. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act is a Federal law that makes it illegal for some groups to discriminate against you based on genetic information. This law applies to all health insurance companies, group health plans, and employers with 15 or more employees. This law does not apply to companies that sell life insurance, disability insurance, or long-term care insurance. <br /><br /><br /><br /></p></div>",,,,,,,,,,,,,

consentcontinued,informed_consent,"What about privacy, authorization for use of Personal Health Information (PHI) and confidentiality? ",descriptive,"As part of this research, health information about you will be collected. This will include information from your medical records and tests. This could include physical exams, imaging studies (MRI scans), pathology results, NF1 germline testing results, or medications. Medical records are available to all CHOP staff. Staff will view your records only when required as part of their job. Staff are required to keep your information private. Information that could identify you will not be shared with anyone- unless you provide your written consent, or it is required or allowed by law. We will do our best to keep your personal information private and confidential. However, we cannot guarantee absolute confidentiality. Your personal information may be disclosed if required by law.

The results of this study may be shown at meetings and published in journals to inform other doctors and health professionals. We will keep your identity private in any publication or presentation. 

Several people and organizations may review or receive your identifiable information. They will need this information to conduct the research, to assure the quality of the data, or to analyze the data or samples. These groups include:
•	Members of the research team and authorized staff at CHOP
•	People from agencies and organizations that perform independent accreditation and/or oversight of research, such as the Department of Health and Human Services, Office for Human Research Protections
•	Representatives of the Gilbert Family Foundation, who is funding this research
•	Your tumor samples will be evaluated by outside laboratories, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center if you are in the United States and Hopp Children's Cancer Center (Heidelberg, Germany) if you are located in the European Union. Private information such as your name, birth date or medical record number will not be shared with them. Your samples/data will be coded with a study number when shipped to the laboratory. 

By law, CHOP is required to protect your health information. The research staff will only allow access to your health information to the groups listed above. By signing this document, you are authorizing CHOP to use and/or release your health information for this research. Some of the organizations listed above may not be required to protect your information under Federal privacy laws. If permitted by law, they may be allowed to share it with others without your permission. 

The identifiable information from this study will be destroyed 6 years after the study is completed.

Your permission to use and share the information and data from this study will continue until the research study ends and will not expire. Researchers continue to analyze data for many years, and it is not possible to know when they will be completely done. De-identified data will be entered into the Synapse NF Data Portal at the conclusion of this study. The Synapse NF Data Portal is designed to support accelerated and collaborative NF research through sharing of NF datasets, analysis tools, resources, and publications related to neurofibromatosis. Private information such as name, birth date, or medical record number will not be entered.
